# /ui.axialy.ai/assets/

This folder holds all of the static assets used by the UI:

- **css/**  
  All stylesheet files, one per feature/tab/overlay.

- **img/**  
  Image assets (icons, favicon, etc.)

There are no other files at this levelâ€”everything is organized into those two subdirectories.
